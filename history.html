        <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
        <p>Born in 1865, Taichiro Morinaga came from very little. He grew up without the privilege of having an education and was only seven years old when he lost his father. Morinaga was only 23 when he had moved to the States with the sole purpose of figuring out what he wanted to do with his life. His life changed when a stranger offered him his first ever piece of candy. Taking what he learned in the states, he was inspired to create and sell his own candy back in his home country of Japan. Over the span of 20 years, Morinaga was able to successfully establish his own company which continues to sell some of Asia's most popular treats.</p>
